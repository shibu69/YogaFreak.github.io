# YogaFreak.github.io
Hello everyone

I made this website for the refrence of a hypothetical yoga class. You will be able to register for the class.

It is a complete full stack website made by using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

Currently, I didn't hosted it anywhere it runs only on local host

You can see a home page, service page and a register page.

When you register and enter you detail, your registered data will be stored on the MongoDB data base
